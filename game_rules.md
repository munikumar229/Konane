# Konane (Hawaiian Checkers) Game Rules

Konane is a traditional Hawaiian board game that is often referred to as "Hawaiian Checkers." It is a strategy-based game played on an 8x8 board with two players: Black and White. The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces by jumping over them, and to be the last player who can make a valid move.

## Objective of the Game

The goal of Konane is to eliminate all of your opponent's pieces by jumping over them, while also ensuring you have at least one piece remaining on the board. The game is won when the opponent has no more valid moves left and can no longer play.

## Setup

1. **Board Setup:** The game is played on an 8x8 square grid. The pieces are placed on the board as follows:
   - Black pieces (denoted as 'B') are placed on the black squares (alternating squares) of the first four rows of the board.
   - White pieces (denoted as 'W') are placed on the white squares (alternating squares) of the last four rows of the board.

2. **Starting the Game:** The Black player always begins the game and must remove one of their pieces from either a corner or a center piece during the opening phase.

## Game Phases

### Opening Phase

1. **Black's Turn:** The game starts with the Black player. Black must remove one of their pieces from a corner or the center of the board. The piece is removed by clicking on it.
2. **White's Turn:** After Black's move, the White player removes one of their pieces adjacent to the Black piece that was just removed. The piece is removed by clicking on it.

After these initial moves, the game transitions to the main **Play Phase**.

### Play Phase

1. **Taking Turns:** Players take turns moving pieces by jumping over their opponent's pieces. A jump consists of moving a piece over an adjacent opponent's piece to an empty square on the opposite side.
   
2. **Jumping:** 
   - To jump over an opponent's piece, a player must move their piece two squares in a row (horizontally or vertically), landing on an empty square.
   - The opponent's piece in the middle of the jump is removed from the board.
   - Players can perform multiple jumps on a single turn, provided they jump over one opponent's piece at a time and land on an empty square.

3. **Valid Jumps:** A jump is valid if the following conditions are met:
   - The opponent’s piece is directly adjacent to the player’s piece (in the direction of the jump).
   - The destination square after the jump is empty.
   - The player must jump over one opponent's piece at a time.

4. **Multiple Jumps:** If a player has multiple valid jumps available, they must continue jumping until no further jumps are possible.

5. **Passing the Turn:** If a player has no valid moves left, they must pass their turn. The player may also choose to pass voluntarily when no further jumps are possible, and the opponent must take their turn.

## Ending the Game

The game ends when neither player has a valid move left to make. This occurs when all of the pieces have been captured, or when a player is unable to make any more valid jumps.

- **Winning:** The player who still has valid moves remaining at the end of the game wins. The opponent has no more pieces left or cannot make a move, and the winner is declared.
- **Draw:** The game may end in a draw if both players run out of moves simultaneously.

## Game Strategy Tips

- **Opening Phase Strategy:** Black has the advantage of starting the game by removing a corner or center piece. It's essential to carefully select a piece that opens up the best opportunity for further jumps in the future.
  
- **Control the Center:** Like many other board games, controlling the center of the board in Konane allows for more flexibility and more available moves. It's often a good idea to keep pieces in the middle where they have more room to jump.

- **Plan Ahead:** Always try to plan your moves ahead and think about the consequences of each jump. If you can force your opponent into a position where they have no valid moves, you will gain the upper hand.

- **Multiple Jumps:** Look for opportunities to make multiple jumps in one turn. If you can jump over several opponent pieces, you can quickly reduce their number and limit their options.

- **Passing the Turn:** If you're in a position where you have no valid moves, passing your turn is often the best choice, allowing your opponent to make a move and possibly place themselves in a more disadvantageous position.
